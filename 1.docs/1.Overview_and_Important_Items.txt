The Snip Viz is written in Javascript.


The Snip Viz can be created in multiple divs on the same page (with different data for each one).

   Examples of Snip Viz implementations can be viewed at http://www.yeastrc.org/snipviz/

   A current implementation of Snip Viz is at http://www.yeastrc.org/g2p/phenomeviewProtein.do?orfName=YCR088W&listing=ABP1+%2f+YCR088W


Important Items:

1.  The div the Snip Viz is created in must not be hidden with "display:none" at the time
       the Snip Viz is created.  This included all parent divs or other elements.
       It can be hidden with "visibility:hidden".

2.  The bulk of the code to create the Snip Viz runs on a delay (inside a setTimeout).
	This means that the Snip Viz will be created after other code is done.
	If other code is triggered by "onload" or "$(document).ready(function(){...})"
	The Snip Viz code will run after all of that.
	There are ways to deal with this.  See the "3.Advanced_Items.txt" file.

3.	If the Snip Viz (or the div it is created in) needs to be removed from the page with
	Javascript code, please see the "3.Advanced_Items.txt" file.
