Advanced Snip Viz Items

1.  If there is a need to run code after the Snip Viz has been successfully created,
    a call back function can be created and passed to the Snip Viz creation function.
    That function will be called when the Snip Viz has been successfully created.

	An example of this is 7.retrieve_fasta_sequences_from_server_and_call_backs/snip_viz_fasta_only.html


2.	If the Snip Viz (or the div it is created in) needs to be removed from the page with
	Javascript code, please use one of the following methods:

	a.  Call:   SNPViewer.deleteSNPViewerFromRootDivId( /* rootDivId */ "rootDivId"   )
	b.	Use the jQuery function empty() function on the div the Snip Viz is created in or a parent element

	If the div is removed using the HTML innerHTML method, the attached Snip Viz data will not be removed
	and will continue to consume memory in the browser.

	The Snip Viz is removed automatically if the user navigates to a different page.
