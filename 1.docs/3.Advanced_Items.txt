Advanced Snip Viz Items
    

1.  jQuery and/or jQuery-ui already on the page

    Do not include jquery or jquery-ui a second time onto the page.

    If jquery and or jquery-ui are already in use, please refer to the table below for compatible
    between Snip Viz and jquery and jquery-ui versions:
    
    		Min. Version	Max. Tested Version
    jquery	1.5.2		2.1.1
    jquery-ui	1.7.0		1.10.4

    If your existing version of jquery or jquery-ui are below the minimum version listed above, you
    will need to upgrade them for Snip Viz to function correctly. The maximum tested version listed
    above represent the most current versions at the time of this writing and Snip Viz was found to
    be compatible.


2.  If there is a need to run code after the Snip Viz has been successfully created,
    a call back function can be created and passed to the Snip Viz creation function.
    That function will be called when the Snip Viz has been successfully created.

    An example of this is 2.Demo_From_Filesystem-DNA/snip_viz_Demo_From_Filesystem-DNA.html


3.  If the Snip Viz (or the div it is created in) needs to be removed from the page with
    Javascript code, please use one of the following methods:

        a.  Call:   SNPViewer.deleteSNPViewerFromRootDivId( /* rootDivId */ "rootDivId"   )
        b.  Use the jQuery function empty() function on the div the Snip Viz is created in or a parent element

    If the div is removed using the HTML innerHTML method, the attached Snip Viz data will not be removed
    and will continue to consume memory in the browser.

    The Snip Viz is removed automatically if the user navigates to a different page.
