The SNP viewer is written in Javascript.

The SNP viewer can be instantiated in multiple divs on the same page.


The minimum files/components to use the SNP viewer are in the folder "SNP_Viewer_components".

jquery-ui is used for draggable( ) function.


**  Creating a SNP viewer:


The call to the SNP viewer core create is:

	SNPViewer.createSNPViewer( /* rootDivId */ "rootDivId" ,
                               /* requestParams */ { newick: "", sequences: {   "DBVPG6765":"ATGG"  }, requestType: SNPViewer.getRequestTypeDNA(), requestTypeLabel: "bases"; },
                               /* configParams */  {  },
                               /* callbackFunctions */  { successfullyLoadedCallback: function() {  }, failToLoadCallBack: function() {  } }  );


	An example is in simple_sample_webapp\js\snp_viewer_loader_data_object_provided.js


     **   Explanation of parameters:


    rootDivId: The first parameter.  A string that is the id of the container div to insert the SNP viewer in.


	requestParams:

		newick:  The clustering information for the strains.

		sequences:  The sequences for the strains.  The strain names are the property names and the sequences are the values.

		requestType:  Must either SNPViewer.getRequestTypeDNA() or SNPViewer.getRequestTypeProtein().
						The choice drives formatting and how the values are compared to generate the scores for highlighting.

		requestTypeLabel: A string used as a label within the SNP viewer.

	configParams:   Unused

	callbackFunctions:

		successfullyLoadedCallback: a function that is called when the SNP viewer is successfully created.

		failToLoadCallBack: a function that is called if the SNP viewer has errors while creating the SNP viewer.


**  Removing the SNP viewer

The call to remove the SNP viewer is:

	SNPViewer.deleteSNPViewerFromRootDivId( /* rootDivId */ "rootDivId"   );

If the enclosing div is removed without using the provided function ( or the jQuery function empty()  ),
the SNP viewer data and registered handlers may remain in memory.

The SNP viewer is removed automatically if the user navigates to a different page.



To get a quick sample of the SNP viewer, go into the
folder simple_sample_webapp and open snp_viewer.html in any browser.
