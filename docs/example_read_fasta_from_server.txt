"example_read_fasta_from_server" folder contents:

The SNP viewer in the folder "example_read_fasta_from_server"
provides additional javascript code in the file "snp_viewer_get_data_external_file.js"
to load the newick clustering information and sequences from external resources.
It processes those into the format the core SNP viewer code uses to create
the SNP viewer on the page.

** Specifying the gene name:

This line in the file "snp_viewer.html" specifies the name of the gene to load:

		var geneName = "gene1";

This can be hard coded or dynamically changed using any server side or client side scripting code.


** File formats

  ** newick file

The filename of the newick file is the gene name followed by ".newick".

The format of the newick file is a standard newick format spread across any number of lines.

  ** fasta file

The filename of the fasta file is the gene name followed by ".fa".

The format of the fasta file is a standard fasta file.
There can be only one header line per sequence.

On the header line, the strain name is immediately after the ">".
The strain name is separated from the rest of the header contents by white space ( space, tab, etc. ).

The lines containing the sequence will be used start to end.
Any leading or trailing spaces will be used and not trimmed.
















The file "snp_viewer_get_data_external_file.js" can be modified to process files in similar formats.

If you are loading data and get a message that the SNP viewer failed to load,
check the console in the browser for the error.
